## Rules to Manage our Group Library

1. If you are the first one that add the item, you have the right to decide the citation key. If you do not give a key, the system will automatically generate one for you.
2. If you add a new item (or a batch of items), always check the duplicated items. If the item already exists, you are responsible to remove your duplicated items.
3. You have make sure that the citation key of your paper in our SVN is consistent with the citation key in our group library.
