* I have received my Ph.D. degree in December 2023 from the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.ust.hk/), [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://www.ust.hk/).
* My thesis supervisor is [Prof. S.-H. Gary Chan](http://www.cse.ust.hk/~gchan/).
* I received the B.Sc. degree (highest honor) in Physics and Computer Science (double major), and the M.Phil. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from HKUST in 2011 and 2015, respectively.
* My research interests include multimedia networking, fog/edge computing, and video/location data analytics.
